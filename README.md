This website was built using the following technologies:
PHP
HTML
CSS
Gulp
NPM
Sass
The website is a simple portfolio and blog website that showcases my skills and experience. 

I used PHP to use templates for the menus and subscription forms. Also used HTML, CSS, and Sass to create the front end. 
Finally, I used Gulp, SASS, and NPM to automate the development process, to help me to speed up the development process and reduce the risk of errors.

So far, I'm proud of this project and I feel confident that it is a good example of my skills and experience.
